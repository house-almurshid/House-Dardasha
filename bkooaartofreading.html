      <p>
        In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to 
        which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, 
        since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, 
        theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, 
        and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of G. E. Moore and J. M. Keynes: from the former, 
        as regards the relations of sense-data to physical objects, 
        and from the latter as regards probability and induction. 
        I have also profited greatly by the criticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.

      <p>
        Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? 
        This question, which at first sight might not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that 
        can be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a straightforward and confident answer, 
        we shall be well launched on the study of philosophy—for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer such 
        ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in ordinary life and even in the sciences, 
        but critically, after exploring all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the 
        vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.<a id="footnotetag1"
    name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" class="text-red-600"><sup>1</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p class="incomplete-para">
        In daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer scrutiny, are found to be so full of 
        apparent contradictions that only a great amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really 
        may believe. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our present experiences, and in some 
        sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be derived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate 
        experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that I am now sitting in a chair, 
        at a table of a certain shape, on which I see sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see 
        out of the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun is about ninety-three million 
        miles from the earth; that it is a hot globe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth's 
        rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefinite time in the future. 
        I believe that, if any other normal person comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables 
        and books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which I feel pressing 
        against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who 
        doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted, and&nbsp;all&nbsp;of&nbsp;it&nbsp;requires

        much careful discussion before we can be sure that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention on the table. To the eye it is oblong, 
        brown and shiny, to the touch it is smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound. 
        Any one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this description, so that it might 
        seem as if no difficulty would arise; but as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. 
        Although I believe that the table is 'really' of the same colour all over, the parts that reflect the 
        light look much brighter than the other parts, and some parts look white because of reflected light. 
        I know that, if I move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the apparent 
        distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows that if several people are looking at the 
        table at the same moment, no two of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because no 
        two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in the point of view makes some change 
        in the way the light is reflected.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, but to the painter they are all-important: 
        the painter has to unlearn the habit of thinking that things seem to have the colour which common 
        sense says they 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they appear. Here we have 
        already the beginning of one of the distinctions that cause most trouble in philosophy—the distinction 
        between 'appearance' and 'reality', between what things seem to be and what they are. 
        The painter wants to know what things seem to be, the practical man and the philosopher want to 
        know what they are; but the philosopher's wish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, 
        and is more troubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.
      </p>
      <p class="incomplete-para">
        To return to the table. It is evident from what we have found, that there is no colour which pre-eminently 
        appears to be the colour of the table, or even of any one particular part of the table—it appears to be of 
        different colours from different points of view, and there is no reason for regarding some of these as more 
        really its colour than others. And we know that even from a given point of view the colour will seem 
        different by artificial light, or to a colour-blind man, or to a man wearing blue spectacles, while in the 
        dark there will be no colour at all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. This colour 
        is not something which is inherent in the table, but something depending upon the table and the spectator 
        and the way the light falls on the table. When, in ordinary life, we speak of the colour of the table, we 
        only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a normal spectator from an ordinary point of 
        view under usual conditions of light. But the other colours which appear under other

      <p class="no-indent">conditions have just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid favouritism, we are 
        compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any one particular colour.

      <p class="text-center font-bold text-2xl mb-4">THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER</p>
      <p>
        In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all, there is such a thing as matter. 
        Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, 
        or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very prolonged dream? 
        This question is of the greatest importance. For if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, 
        we cannot be sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and therefore still less 
        of other people's minds, since we have no grounds for believing in their minds except such as are derived 
        from observing their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, 
        we shall be left alone in a desert—it may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, 
        and that we alone exist. This is an uncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved 
        to be false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true. In this chapter we have to see 
        why this is the case.
      </p>

      <p class="text-center font-bold text-2xl mb-4">THE NATURE OF MATTER</p>
      <p>
        In the preceding chapter we agreed, though without being able to find demonstrative reasons, 
        that it is rational to believe that our sense-data—for example, those which we regard as associated 
        with my table—are really signs of the existence of something independent of us and our perceptions. 
        That is to say, over and above the sensations of colour, hardness, noise, and so on, 
        which make up the appearance of the table to me, I assume that there is something else, 
        of which these things are appearances. The colour ceases to exist if I shut my eyes, 
        the sensation of hardness ceases to exist if I remove my arm from contact with the table, 
        the sound ceases to exist if I cease to rap the table with my knuckles. But I do not believe that 
        when all these things cease the table ceases. On the contrary, I believe that it is because the table 
        exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear when I open my eyes, replace my arm, 
        and begin again to rap with my knuckles. The question we have to consider in this chapter is: 
        What is the nature of this real table, which persists independently of my perception of it? 
      </p>

      <p class="text-center font-bold text-2xl mb-4">ON INDUCTION</p>
      <p>
        In almost all our previous discussions we have been concerned in the attempt to get clear as to our 
        data in the way of knowledge of existence. What things are there in the universe whose existence is 
        known to us owing to our being acquainted with them? So far, our answer has been that we are acquainted 
        with our sense-data, and, probably, with ourselves. These we know to exist. And past sense-data which 
        are remembered are known to have existed in the past. This knowledge supplies our data.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if we are to be able to draw inferences from these data—if we are to know of the existence of matter, 
        of other people, of the past before our individual memory begins, or of the future, we must know general 
        principles of some kind by means of which such inferences can be drawn. It must be known to us that the 
        existence of some one sort of thing, A, is a sign of the existence of some other sort of thing, B, 
        either at the same time as A or at some earlier or later time, as, for example, thunder is a sign of the 
        earlier existence of lightning. If this were not known to us, we could never extend our knowledge beyond 
        the sphere of our private experience; and this sphere, as we have seen, is exceedingly limited. The question 
        we have now to consider is whether such an extension is possible, and if so, how it is effected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us take as an illustration a matter about which none of us, in fact, feel the slightest doubt. We are all 
        convinced that the sun will rise to-morrow. Why? Is this belief a mere blind outcome of past experience, 
        or can it be justified as a reasonable belief? It is not easy to find a test by which to judge whether a 
        belief of this kind is reasonable or not, but we can at least ascertain what sort of general beliefs would 
        suffice, if true, to justify the judgement that the sun will rise to-morrow, and the many other similar 
        judgements upon which our actions are based.
      </p>
      <p class="incomplete-para">
        It is obvious that if we are asked why we believe&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;sun will&nbsp;rise

        to-morrow, we shall naturally answer 'Because it always has risen every day'. We have a firm belief that it 
        will rise in the future, because it has risen in the past. If we are challenged as to why we believe that it 
        will continue to rise as heretofore, we may appeal to the laws of motion: the earth, we shall say, is a freely 
        rotating body, and such bodies do not cease to rotate unless something interferes from outside, and there is 
        nothing outside to interfere with the earth between now and to-morrow. Of course it might be doubted 
        whether we are quite certain that there is nothing outside to interfere, but this is not the interesting doubt. 
        The interesting doubt is as to whether the laws of motion will remain in operation until to-morrow. 
        If this doubt is raised, we find ourselves in the same position as when the doubt about the sunrise was first raised.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only reason for believing that the laws of motion will remain in operation is that they have operated 
        hitherto, so far as our knowledge of the past enables us to judge. It is true that we have a greater body 
        of evidence from the past in favour of the laws of motion than we have in favour of the sunrise, because the 
        sunrise is merely a particular case of fulfilment of the laws of motion, and there are countless other 
        particular cases. But the real question is: Do any number of cases of a law being fulfilled in the past afford 
        evidence that it will be fulfilled in the future? If not, it becomes plain that we have no ground whatever for 
        expecting the sun to rise to-morrow, or for expecting the bread we shall eat at our next meal not to poison us, 
        or for any of the other scarcely conscious expectations that control our daily lives. It is to be observed that 
        all such expectations are only probable; thus we have not to seek for a proof that they must be fulfilled, 
        but only for some reason in favour of the view that they are likely to be fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in dealing with this question we must, to begin with, make an important distinction, without which we 
        should soon become involved in hopeless confusions. Experience has shown us that, hitherto, the frequent 
        repetition of some uniform succession or coexistence has been a cause of our expecting the same succession or 
        coexistence on the next occasion. Food that has a certain appearance generally has a certain taste, 
        and it is a severe shock to our expectations when the familiar appearance is found to be associated with 
        an unusual taste. Things which we see become associated, by habit, with certain tactile sensations which 
        we expect if we touch them; one of the horrors of a ghost (in many ghost-stories) is that it fails to give 
        us any sensations of touch. Uneducated people who go abroad for the first time are so surprised as to be 
        incredulous when they find their native language not understood.
      </p>
      <p class="incomplete-para">
        And this kind of association is not confined to men; in animals also it is
      </p>
      <hr class="border-black mt-10 my-2">
        <p class="page-number text-right mb-4"> Page: 35</p>

        very strong. A horse which has been often driven along a certain road resists the attempt to drive him in 
        a different direction. Domestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. 
        We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. 
        The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing 
        that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in spite of the misleadingness of such expectations, they nevertheless exist. The mere fact that 
        something has happened a certain number of times causes animals and men to expect that it will happen again. 
        Thus our instincts certainly cause us to believe that the sun will rise to-morrow, but we may be in no better 
        a position than the chicken which unexpectedly has its neck wrung. We have therefore to distinguish the fact 
        that past uniformities cause expectations as to the future, from the question whether there is any 
        reasonable ground for giving weight to such expectations after the question of their validity has been raised.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem we have to discuss is whether there is any reason for believing in what is called 'the uniformity 
        of nature'. The belief in the uniformity of nature is the belief that everything that has happened or will 
        happen is an instance of some general law to which there are no exceptions. The crude expectations which we 
        have been considering are all subject to exceptions, and therefore liable to disappoint those who entertain 
        them. But science habitually assumes, at least as a working hypothesis, that general rules which have exceptions 
        can be replaced by general rules which have no exceptions. 'Unsupported bodies in air fall' is a general rule 
        to which balloons and aeroplanes are exceptions. But the laws of motion and the law of gravitation, which 
        account for the fact that most bodies fall, also account for the fact that balloons and aeroplanes can rise; 
        thus the laws of motion and the law of gravitation are not subject to these exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The belief that the sun will rise to-morrow might be falsified if the earth came suddenly into contact with a 
        large body which destroyed its rotation; but the laws of motion and the law of gravitation would not be 
        infringed by such an event. The business of science is to find uniformities, such as the laws of motion 
        and the law of gravitation, to which, so far as our experience extends, there are no exceptions. 
        In this search science has been remarkably successful, and it may be conceded that such uniformities have held 
        hitherto. This brings us back to the question: Have we any reason, assuming that they have always 
        held in the past, to suppose that they will hold in the future?
      </p>
      <p class="incomplete-para">
        It has been argued that we have reason to know that the future will resemble the past, 
        because what was the future has&nbsp;onstantly become&nbsp;the

        past, and has always been found to resemble the past, so that we really have experience of the future, 
        namely of times which were formerly future, which we may call past futures. But such an argument really 
        begs the very question at issue. We have experience of past futures, but not of future futures, and the 
        question is: Will future futures resemble past futures? This question is not to be answered by an argument 
        which starts from past futures alone. We have therefore still to seek for some principle which shall enable 
        us to know that the future will follow the same laws as the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reference to the future in this question is not essential. The same question arises when we apply 
        the laws that work in our experience to past things of which we have no experience—as, for example, 
        in geology, or in theories as to the origin of the Solar System. The question we really have to ask is: 
        'When two things have been found to be often associated, and no instance is known of the one occurring 
        without the other, does the occurrence of one of the two, in a fresh instance, give any good ground for 
        expecting the other?' On our answer to this question must depend the validity of the whole of our 
        expectations as to the future, the whole of the results obtained by induction, and in fact practically 
        all the beliefs upon which our daily life is based.
      </p>
      <p>
        It must be conceded, to begin with, that the fact that two things have been found often together and never 
        apart does not, by itself, suffice to prove demonstratively that they will be found together in the next 
        case we examine. The most we can hope is that the oftener things are found together, the more probable it 
        becomes that they will be found together another time, and that, if they have been found together often 
        enough, the probability will amount almost to certainty. It can never quite reach certainty, because we 
        know that in spite of frequent repetitions there sometimes is a failure at the last, as in the case of 
        the chicken whose neck is wrung. Thus probability is all we ought to seek.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be urged, as against the view we are advocating, that we know all natural phenomena to be subject 
        to the reign of law, and that sometimes, on the basis of observation, we can see that only one law can possibly 
        fit the facts of the case. Now to this view there are two answers. The first is that, even if some law which 
        has no exceptions applies to our case, we can never, in practice, be sure that we have discovered that law 
        and not one to which there are exceptions. The second is that the reign of law would seem to be itself only 
        probable, and that our belief that it will hold in the future, or in unexamined cases in the past, is itself 
        based upon the very principle we are examining.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principle we are examining may be called the principle of induction, and its two parts may be stated as follows:
      </p>
      <hr class="border-black mt-10 my-2">
        <p class="page-number text-right mb-4"> Page: 37</p>
      <p>
        (a) When a thing of a certain sort A has been found to be associated with a thing of a certain other sort B, 
        and has never been found dissociated from a thing of the sort B, the greater the number of cases in which A 
        and B have been associated, the greater is the probability that they will be associated in a fresh case in 
        which one of them is known to be present;
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of association will make the probability of 
        a fresh association nearly a certainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        As just stated, the principle applies only to the verification of our expectation in a single fresh instance. 
        But we want also to know that there is a probability in favour of the general law that things of the sort 
        A are always associated with things of the sort B, provided a sufficient number of cases of association are 
        known, and no cases of failure of association are known. The probability of the general law is obviously 
        less than the probability of the particular case, since if the general law is true, the particular case must 
        also be true, whereas the particular case may be true without the general law being true. Nevertheless the 
        probability of the general law is increased by repetitions, just as the probability of the particular case is. 
        We may therefore repeat the two parts of our principle as regards the general law, thus:
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) The greater the number of cases in which a thing of the sort A has been found associated with a thing 
        of the sort B, the more probable it is (if no cases of failure of association are known) that A is always 
        associated with B;
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of the association of A with B will make it nearly 
        certain that A is always associated with B, and will make this general law approach certainty without limit.
      </p>
      <p class="incomplete-para">
        It should be noted that probability is always relative to certain data. In our case, the data are merely the 
        known cases of coexistence of A and B. There may be other data, which might be taken into account, which would 
        gravely alter the probability. For example, a man who had seen a great many white swans might argue, by our 
        principle, that on the data it was probable that all swans were white, and this might be a perfectly sound 
        argument. The argument is not disproved by the fact that some swans are black, because a thing may very well 
        happen in spite of the fact that some data render it improbable. In the case of the swans, a man might know 
        that colour is a very variable characteristic in many species of animals, and that, therefore, an induction as 
        to colour is peculiarly liable to error. But this knowledge would be a fresh datum, by no means proving that 
        the probability relatively to our previous data had been wrongly estimated. The fact, therefore, that things 
        often fail to fulfil our expectations is no evidence that our expectations will not probably be fulfilled in 
        a given case or a given
      </p>
      <hr class="border-black mt-10 my-2">
      <p class="page-number text-right mb-4"> Page: 38</p>
      <p class="no-indent">
        class of cases. Thus our inductive principle is at any rate not capable of being disproved by an appeal to experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inductive principle, however, is equally incapable of being proved by an appeal to experience. Experience 
        might conceivably confirm the inductive principle as regards the cases that have been already examined; 
        but as regards unexamined cases, it is the inductive principle alone that can justify any inference from 
        what has been examined to what has not been examined. All arguments which, on the basis of experience, 
        argue as to the future or the unexperienced parts of the past or present, assume the inductive principle; 
        hence we can never use experience to prove the inductive principle without begging the question. Thus we must 
        either accept the inductive principle on the ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of 
        our expectations about the future. If the principle is unsound, we have no reason to expect the sun to rise 
        to-morrow, to expect bread to be more nourishing than a stone, or to expect that if we throw ourselves off 
        the roof we shall fall. When we see what looks like our best friend approaching us, we shall have no reason to 
        suppose that his body is not inhabited by the mind of our worst enemy or of some total stranger. All our conduct 
        is based upon associations which have worked in the past, and which we therefore regard as likely to work in the 
        future; and this likelihood is dependent for its validity upon the inductive principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general principles of science, such as the belief in the reign of law, and the belief that every event 
        must have a cause, are as completely dependent upon the inductive principle as are the beliefs of daily life 
        All such general principles are believed because mankind have found innumerable instances of their truth and 
        no instances of their falsehood. But this affords no evidence for their truth in the future, unless the 
        inductive principle is assumed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus all knowledge which, on a basis of experience tells us something about what is not experienced, 
        is based upon a belief which experience can neither confirm nor confute, yet which, at least in its more 
        concrete applications, appears to be as firmly rooted in us as many of the facts of experience. 
        The existence and justification of such beliefs—for the inductive principle, as we shall see, is not 
        the only example—raises some of the most difficult and most debated problems of philosophy. 
        We will, in the next chapter, consider briefly what may be said to account for such knowledge, and what is 
        its scope and its degree of certainty.

        Having now come to the end of our brief and very incomplete review of the problems of philosophy, 
        it will be well to consider, in conclusion, what is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. 
        It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of 
        science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent 
        but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is 
        impossible.
