      <p class="text-lg">
        When you learn something it makes a difference. There is something you can do that
you could not do before, like play the piano, or there is something that you now know
that you did not know before, like what ‘empirical’ means. When something stays in
the mind, we assume it is stored somewhere, and we call this storage system
‘memory’. The system does not work perfectly: we sometimes have to ‘rack our
brains’ or ‘search our memories’, but perhaps the most common preconception about
what stays in the mind is that there is a place where it is all stored. Sometimes we
cannot find what we want, but it is probably there somewhere if only we knew where
to look. Psychologists’ discoveries about learning and memory show that the two
processes are interdependent but that the analogy of the repository is not accurate.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        About memory, William James asked in 1890:
      </p>
      <p>
        why should this absolute god-given Faculty retain so much better the events of yesterday than those of last
year, and, best of all, those of an hour ago? Why, again, in old age should its grasp of childhood’s events
seem firmest? Why should repeating an experience strengthen our recollection of it? Why should drugs,
fevers, asphyxia, and excitement resuscitate things long since forgotten?…such peculiarities seem quite
fantastic; and might, for aught we can see a priori, be the precise opposites of what they are. Evidently,
then, the faculty does not exist absolutely, but works under conditions; and the quest of the conditions
becomes the psychologist’s most interesting task. (Principles of Psychology, i. 3)
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mt-8">
        Understanding what stays in the mind is still a challenge. First, it is important to
recognize that learning and memory are two sides of the same coin: we know that
people (and animals) have learned something when they show or tell us what they
remember. Some change has registered in their brains, and cognitive scientists,
including psychologists, have discovered much about the processes involved in
creating and maintaining this change. Box 4 provides an example with important
implications for both learning and memory, and clearly the research raises questions
as well as answering them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        This kind of research was made possible by the development of in vivo neuroimaging
techniques, which are able to visualize the structure and workings of the living human
brain. During the research described in Box 4 MRI scanners measured volumetric
differences in the hippocampus, which plays a crucial part in the formation of new
memories. These and subsequent results can tell us about the plasticity of the brain,
about the functions of specific parts of the brain and how they operate, about
structural pathways which link different parts of the brain, about which functions are
separately organized, and how different functions interact. Similarly, such studies can
have implications for rehabilitation, for example in memory-impaired patients.
      </p>
      <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8">
        Box 4 Navigating and the brain
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        The brains of London taxi drivers change as they become expert navigators. The
volume of grey matter in the mid-posterior hippocampus increases, and in the
anterior hippocampus it decreases. The more years of experience the greater these
changes. No such changes are found in the brains of London bus drivers, matched
in many ways, including for driving experience and level of stress, but who
follow predetermined routes rather than developing the navigational expertise of
taxi drivers. However there is also a cost: the decreases in grey matter are
associated with difficulty in acquiring new visuo-spatial memories.
